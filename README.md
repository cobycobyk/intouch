## Why is inTouch the simplest way to connect with your team?
inTouch allows you to stay connected to your employees and teammates by sending texts directly from the inTouch app. By sending text message updates from a single app, your team can stay connected without cumbersome group texts or multiple messaging apps.

## Next Steps
In the future we would like to add groups so that recipients can be organized and multiple groups can be selected. We also would like to add the ability to send emails and texts simulataneously. Eventually will also include pricing tiers so users can use the free-mium version or choose to pay for more organization and customization.
